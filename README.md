Please solve the following exercises and post your solutions on Canvas as a single pdf with everything + source files. The datasets for Faraway's problems are available online at https://github.com/julianfaraway/LMP/tree/master Note this is from the Python edition of the book! 

The deadline is Monday, Sep 9, midnight (23:59).

IMPORTANT: Late submissions will NOT be accepted! You have only one attempt at submission. 

1) Ex. 1, Faraway (2021), pp. 131-132 Q1(Ex1, pp131-132).jpgDownload Q1(Ex1, pp131-132).jpg

2) Either Ex. 4 or Ex. 5, Faraway (2021), pp. 195 (up to you which one to do) Q2(Ex4-5, p195).jpgDownload Q2(Ex4-5, p195).jpg

3) Run a logistic regression on Black Spruceâ€ƒBlowdown Data available at http://users.stat.umn.edu/~sandy/alr4ed/data/ (file name is "blowdown")

You are estimating the dependence of the probability of blowdown (y=1 if a particular tree died as a result of the blowdown, and y=0 if it survived) on some factors. This problem is solved in (Weisberg, pp. 274-277), which can be consulted, but the results must be reproduced with all the details, outputs and intermediate stages of your work. Pp274-277.jpg
